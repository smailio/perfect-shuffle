## What this is for  ? 
Every serious deck building game player knows that a bad shuffling leads to anger and frustration. Worse, a player can develop paranoia which will lead him to think that shuffling a deck for 10 minutes using his best shuffling technique learnt on youtube is still not enough, this app brings perfect randomness to those fellows.

##### Tips
Often you don't need to layout the cards as seen in the app, just split the decks into smaller deck and pick the top cards of those decks when the app select a deck to pick from.
